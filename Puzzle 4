You are standing before two doors. One of the path leads to heaven and the other one leads to hell. 
There are two guardians, one by each door. You know one of them always tells the truth and the other 
always lies, but you donâ€™t know who is the honest one and who is the liar. You can only ask one question 
to one of them in order to find the way to heaven. What is the question?
