A bad king has a cellar of 1000 bottles of delightful and very expensive wine. A neighboring queen plots 
to kill the bad king and sends a servant to poison the wine. Fortunately (or say unfortunately) the bad 
king’s guards catch the servant after he has only poisoned one bottle. Alas, the guards don’t know which 
bottle but know that the poison is so strong that even if diluted 100,000 times it would still kill the king. 
Furthermore, it takes one month to have an effect. The bad king decides he will get some of the 
prisoners in his vast dungeons to drink the wine. Being a clever bad king he knows he needs to murder 
no more than 10 prisoners – believing he can fob off such a low death rate – and will still be able to 
drink the rest of the wine (999 bottles) at his anniversary party in 5 weeks time. Explain what is in m
ind of the king, how will he be able to do so ?
